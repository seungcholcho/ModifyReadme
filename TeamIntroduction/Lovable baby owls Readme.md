## 🚀 Project title

A new approach to improving the overall anti-drone system performance
with the implementation of an active malicious drone chasing strategy.
<br><br>




## 📜 Problem Statements

1.  The limitations of sensor categorization include poor resolution due to signal wavelength, limited range affected by signal strength and receiver sensitivity, and weather conditions like rain or fog that can affect accuracy.
2. Unlike military situations, it is difficult to shoot down or mitigate directly in civilian situations.
3. The use of anti-drone systems in civilian areas may cause secondary damage.
<br>
<br>


## ⚖️ Research novelties

1. We solve the limitations of long distances on the sensor and artificial intelligence performance by implementing physical tracking on drones.
2. We concentrate on public anti-drone systems, placing a priority on minimizing unintended secondary damage caused by misrecognition and miscategorization.
3. Being closer to the drone reduces the time required for mitigation, thereby enhancing operational efficiency.
